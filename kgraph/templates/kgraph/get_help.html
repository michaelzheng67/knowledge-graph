      The <span class="font-semibold">Knowledge Graph</span> is a personalized
      tool that helps you visualize and reinforce what you know. Each
      <span class="font-medium text-blue-600">topic</span> you add becomes a
      node in an interactive graph.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      You can attach information to each topic and quiz yourself on it. When you
      answer questions correctly, the corresponding node stays vibrant. If you
      neglect a topic over time, the node
      <span class="italic">gradually fades</span> to represent memory decay.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      By re-quizzing yourself on topics, you can
      <span class="font-semibold text-green-600">revive</span> fading nodes and
      strengthen your understanding again. This makes the graph a living map of
      your retained knowledge.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      The goal is to keep your graph active and bright ‚Äî a reflection of your
      long-term learning and recall. It‚Äôs your brain, visualized.
